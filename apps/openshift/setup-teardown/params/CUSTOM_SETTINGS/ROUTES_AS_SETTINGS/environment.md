# Deployment Package Description

Settings and params for the initial testing of this setup and teardown utility and the templetization of previously hard-coded routing settings in the Angular front-ends (now exposed as OpenShift environment variables).  This is provided as an example of how to deploy eagle from a forked version of the eagle repos, working on temporary branches with different names from the stock eagle deployments, alowing for side-by-side deployments in the same namespace.  Do make sure your names are unique in the param files before you follow this pattern.
