# Deployment Package Description

Settings and params for a temporary EPIC Eagle demo deployment, provided as an example of how to deploy eagle alongside other existing eagle components in the same OpenShift namespace but with different names, same repos, different branches.  

For safety as EAO staff are expecting this deployment to be available for a limited time, the text "no-exist" has been used throughout in lieu of the actual namespace license plate text.  Pull this down locally replace the text.  Take care to only replace it in EAGLE_DEMO and not EAGLE so you never accidentally wipe production eagle.
